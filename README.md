# 👁️ Retinal Image-Based Diabetes Detection using Deep Learning

## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on detecting **diabetic retinopathy** (a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes) from **retinal fundus images** using **deep learning techniques**. The model aims to assist in early diagnosis, which is crucial in preventing vision loss in diabetic patients.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. Manual diagnosis by ophthalmologists can be time-consuming and subjective. This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automate the detection process from retinal images, providing a scalable and efficient solution.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aptos2019-blindness-detection)
- **Format:** Fundus images in `.png` format with labels (0 to 4) indicating severity:
  - 0: No DR
  - 1: Mild
  - 2: Moderate
  - 3: Severe
  - 4: Proliferative DR

> 📌 **Note:** You must download the dataset from Kaggle manually due to their API restrictions.

## 🧪 Approach

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Resize images (e.g., 224x224)
- Normalize pixel values
- Augment dataset to reduce overfitting
- One-hot encode class labels

### 2. **Model Architecture**
- Custom CNN or Transfer Learning using:
  - `ResNet50`
  - `EfficientNet`
  - `InceptionV3`
- Softmax activation for multiclass classification

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC for multi-class (one-vs-rest)
